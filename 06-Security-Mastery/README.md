# 🛡️ Security Mastery

Master web security, network security, and compliance standards.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this section, you will:
- Understand and mitigate OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Implement secure authentication and authorization
- Protect data and network communications
- Ensure compliance with industry standards

## 📁 Structure

### 01-Web-Security
- **OWASP Top 10**: Common vulnerabilities and how to prevent them
- **Authentication**: Secure login systems, session management
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control, permissions
- **Data Protection**: Encryption, sanitization, privacy

### 02-Network-Security
- **HTTPS/SSL**: TLS certificates, secure communications
- **Firewalls**: Network protection, access control
- **VPN**: Secure remote access
- **DDoS Protection**: Mitigation strategies

### 03-Compliance
- **GDPR**: European data protection regulations
- **PCI-DSS**: Payment card industry standards
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare information security
- **SOC2**: Service organization controls

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Start with **01-Web-Security/01-OWASP-Top-10** to understand vulnerabilities
2. Learn **01-Web-Security/02-Authentication** for secure auth
3. Study **02-Network-Security** for infrastructure security
4. Review **03-Compliance** for industry standards

## 🔒 Key Security Principles

- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security
- **Least Privilege**: Minimum necessary access
- **Secure by Default**: Safe defaults
- **Fail Securely**: Graceful error handling
- **Don't Trust User Input**: Always validate and sanitize
